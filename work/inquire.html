                <h3>TLDR</h3>
                <p>
                    I, with the help of my team, designed and built a central user data service for personalization of
                    more than 100 local newspapers.
                    The service integrated <em>data usage monitoring</em> to give data owners high-resolution insight
                    into what
                    data was consumed by who, <em>user consent information</em> to give consumers confidence that they
                    were using data correctly, and <em>data governance</em> to ensure the data platform owners that the
                    service provided up-to-date and valid information.
                    Furthermore, to remove the platform team as a bottleneck when adding user attributes, the service
                    was designed to be as simple to administrate as possible, and includes a well-thought-out management
                    panel.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    At my current company, <a href="https://www.amedia.no/">Amedia</a>, we host and develop for more
                    than 100 local newspaper across Norway.
                    A portion of Amedia's success is owed to partially personalized front pages, along with personalized
                    marketing and communications.
                    Amedia's backend is a collection of (micro) services called in a variety of situations, e.g., to
                    serve the contents of an article, a front-page teaser, or marketing messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since each page load is partially tailored to the logged in user, many of the backend services
                    require attributes of the user in order to function optimally.
                    A large portion of this data is based on gathered analytics, and produced and hosted in our data
                    lake.
                    This lake is naturally optimized for analytical workloads.
                    Performance (and cost) for single-row access (i.e., for a particular user) is infeasible.
                    To support in-flight requests for analytical user data, Amedia has over the course of several years,
                    developed multiple services that host selections of user attributes.
                    <em>Inquire</em> is the third iteration of a user data service made for these purposes.
                    The previous two have been retired for the following reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Monitoring was not built in: No monitoring of data usage made it hard to know what data was
                        actually used, so it was hard to retire attributes.
                        Each request returned all data attributes, so if a client needed a single datapoint, it was
                        impossible to know which.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User consent data was not integrated: Clients had to ask a separate service for data usage
                        consent to know if they could use analytics data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Significant work to add user attributes: Marketing teams move fast to test which
                            personalized messages have desired effects on users.
                            We have considerable amounts of analytics data on our readers, so when these teams generate
                            or discover interesting attributes in our lake, it helps them if they can quickly get this
                            data out to the user data service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Previous iterations of user data services have had hard-coded model and response type in the
                            service application.
                            Additionally, the database schema for these services have had a one-row-per-user layout.
                            While this is great for type safety, it makes the user data service maintainers the main
                            bottleneck for appending attributes to users.
                            This requires significant work: Schema migrations; addition of models for ingest, retrieval
                            and response; transformations between these models.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the previous iterations of the user data service has provided tremendous value for Amedia,
                    Inquire was built to address these shortcomings.
