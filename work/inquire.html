                <h3>TLDR</h3>
                <p>
                    I, with the help of my team, designed and built a central user data service for personalization of
                    more than 100 local newspapers.
                    The service integrated <em>data usage monitoring</em> to give data owners high-resolution insight
                    into what
                    data was consumed by who, <em>user consent information</em> to give consumers confidence that they
                    were using data correctly, and <em>data governance</em> to ensure the data platform owners that the
                    service provided up-to-date and valid information.
                    Furthermore, to remove the platform team as a bottleneck when adding user attributes, the service
                    was designed to be as simple to administrate as possible, and includes a well-thought-out management
                    panel.
